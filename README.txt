All the files were classified by weeks, under each [WEEK] dircetory there are [code] directoy whic contains scripts in .sh, .txt or other types; 
[data] directory which contains data files that been used or can be used by scripts; 
[sandbox] are for fun, that's where I play with(or torture) myself.
under Every [WEEK] directory, there is a seperate README.txt to give an overview of contents in the directory.
