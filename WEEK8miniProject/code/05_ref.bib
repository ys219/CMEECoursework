abstract = {A comparatively recent focus in consumer-resource theory has been the examination of whether adaptive foraging by consumers, manifested through the functional response, can stabilize consumer-resource dynamics. We offer a brief synthesis of progress on this body of theory and identify the conditions likely to lead to stability. We also fill a gap in our understanding by analysing the potential for adaptively foraging herbivores, which are constrained by time available to feed and digestive capacity, to stabilize dynamics in a single-herbivore/two-plant resource system. Because foraging parameters of the adaptive functional response scale allometrically with herbivore body size, we parameterized our model system using published foraging data for an insect, a small mammal and a large mammal spanning four orders of magnitude in body size, and examined numerically the potential for herbivores to stabilize the consumer-resource interactions. We found in general that the herbivore-plant equilibrium will be unstable for all biologically realistic herbivore population densities. The instability arose for two reasons. First, each herbivore exhibited destabilizing adaptive consumer functional responses (i.e. density-independent or inversely density-dependent) whenever they selected a mixed diet. Secondly, the numerical response of herbivores, based on our assumption of density-independent herbivore population growth, results in herbivores reaching densities that enable them to exploit their resource populations to extinction. Our results and those of studies we reviewed indicate that, in general, adaptive consumers are unlikely to stabilize the dynamics of consumer-resource systems solely through the functional response. The implications of this for future work on consumer-resource theory are discussed.},

@article{Solomon1949,
abstract = {A. This paper attempts to clarify the subject by giving a systematic account of the processes considered to be involved in the natural control of animal populations. B. First, a brief survey is made of the chief types of theories offering an explanation of natural control. The earlier theories looked to natural enemies as the main agents of control. Somewhat later theories gave predominance to physical factors. Control has been attributed exclusively to competition, including competition between natural enemies, or, more broadly, to density-dependent mortality. Among theories of periodic fluctuations, many ascribe control to some aspect of overpopulation of the environment, while mathematical theories envisage control due primarily to natural enemies. Certain `comprehensive' theories lay emphasis on the complexity and essential interconnectedness of the population-environment system, and hold that the particular causes of control vary with the circumstances. C. The elements of natural control are outlined as follows: C1. The numerical variation of populations is often considerable and yet is kept within certain limits. C2. A population and the items of its environment form a closely interconnected complex or ecosystem. The relationships of a population are with the whole ecosystem (which includes itself) rather than with the environment only. C3. The distinction between density-dependent and density-independent action is discussed, with examples; it by no means corresponds to the division between biotic and physical factors. Density-dependent action is defined as that which intensifies (per individual) as population density increases, and relaxes as density falls; it is the chief agent of control. Some processes are inversely related to density. Control of a population is a result of the limited capacity of the ecosystem with respect to that species or with respect to its enemies or both. The limiting influence begins to operate at densities far below the capacity limit, intensifying as this limit is approached; this is the basis of most kinds of density dependence (the other kinds are modifications of environmental capacity, the degree of modification naturally depending on density). An enemy is density-dependent in its action on a host (or prey) population if it attacks a greater proportion as the host density increases. The enemy will do this if it is capable, and if the supply of the host is a limiting factor in the enemy's environment. The presence of competitor species, and sometimes that of alternative hosts or prey for the enemies of a population, tends to intensify the action of the control factors involved. C4. Four phases of control are distinguished: limitation, which sets a variable upper limit; conservation, which tends to prevent extreme reduction; suppression, or a forced decline from high density; and release, a temporary escape from normal control after a severe reduction. Each is brought about by characteristic density relationships. Suppression and release promote fluctuations. C5. The level of abundance depends ultimately on all the major elements of the ecosystem, although the density-related, controlling factors are the immediate determinants. Only in regard to particular types of situations, or of animals, can more precise statements be made. D. Some related matters are also discussed: D1. The possibility that either physical or biotic factors may be primarily responsible for control in general is examined. Decisions can be reached only about particular types of situations. D2. Some of the ways in which the term `balance' or `equilibrium' has been applied to population relationships are checked against its physical meaning. It is generally inappropriate to any except nearly constant populations, and this applies equally to `dynamic equilibrium'. To prevent confusion, the above terms should not be used in biology without full explanation of the meaning intended. D3. Although population variation is restricted, the view that density generally fluctuates about a mean value, and the related idea that deviations from this mean set up a tendency to return to it, are over-simplifications. The idea that density tends towards a varying level raises the practical difficulty of distinguishing the two sets of variations, but may be useful. D4. The laboratory demonstration of the `classical' oscillations predicted by the mathematical theories has so far proved very difficult. Instead, `relaxation oscillations', in which the predator population kills all the prey and then dies out, have tended to appear. When `refuges' are available, as in nature, remnants of each population normally survive such crashes, and may increase again. In very regular environments, a succession of these cycles might be maintained; in more general terms, a repeated cycle of suppression and release (see C4) might occur. But this is speculative, and perhaps other causes are more important in producing periodic cycles in nature. D5. There is evidence that animal populations fluctuate less violently in very complex ecosystems, for example in tropical forests, than in woods poorer in plant and animal species, and that the most violent fluctuations tend to occur among the animals in plantations of one species, or in barren places like the far north. Also, irregularities in the physical environment (but not in climate), by increasing the complexity of the ecosystem, probably reduce the numerical variability of populations.},

abstract = {The functional response of a consumer to a gradient of resource density is a widespread and consistent framework used to quantify the importance of consumption to population dynamics and stability. Within benthic marine ecosystems, both crustaceans and fishes can provide strong top-down pressure on prey populations. Taxon-specific differences in biomechanics or habitat use, among other factors, may lead to variable functional response forms or parameter values (attack rate, handling time). Based on a review of 189 individual functional response fits, we find that these predator guilds differ in their frequency distribution of functional response types, with crustaceans exhibiting nearly double the proportion of sigmoidal, density-dependent functional responses (Holling type III) as predatory fishes. The implications of this finding for prey population stability are significant because type III responses allow prey persistence while type II responses are de-stabilizing and can lead to extinction. Comparing per capita predation rates across diverse taxa can provide integrative insights into predatory effects and the ability of predation to drive community structure.},

abstract = {The functional response of a consumer is the relationship between its consumption rate and the abundance of its food. A functional response is said to be of type I if consumption rate increases linearly with food abundance up to a threshold level at which it remains constant. According to conventional wisdom, such type I responses are more frequent among filter feeders than among other consumers. However, the validity of this claim has never been tested. We review 814 functional responses from 235 studies, thereby showing that type I responses are not only exceptionally frequent among filter feeders but that they have only been reported from these consumers. These findings can be understood by considering the conditions that a consumer must fulfil in order to show a type I response. First, the handling condition: the consumer must have a negligibly small handling time (i.e. the time needed for capturing and eating a food item), or it must be able to search for and to capture food while handling other food. Second, the satiation condition: unless its gut is completely filled and gut passage time is minimal, the consumer must search for food at a maximal rate with maximal effort. It thus has to spend much time on foraging (i.e. searching for food and handling it). Our functional response review suggests that only filter feeders sometimes meet both of these conditions. This suggestion is reasonable because filter feeders typically fulfil the handling condition and can meet the satiation condition without losing time, for they are, by contrast to non-filter feeders, able simultaneously to perform foraging and non-foraging activities, such as migration or reproduction.},

abstract = {1. We derived a functional response function that accounted for both predator and prey size. Laboratory experiments were then performed to investigate the size relationships of the functional response of the benthic isopod Saduria entomon (L.) feeding on Monoporeia affinis (Lindstr{\"{o}}m) amphipods. 2. The S. entomon predators, in general, showed sigmoid (type III) functional responses. The attack rate of S. entomon was a bent ridge-shaped function of predator and prey size. The maximum attack rates of small predators were found on small prey, and then attack rate declined rapidly as prey size increased. In large predators attack rate increased slowly up to a maximum for large prey. The shape of the attack rate was dependent on the size scaling of predator and prey body mass in the attack rate function. We suggest that the ridge-shaped attack rate function found in our study is likely to be general for predators that feed on prey with a large size range. The handling time of small S. entomon increased rapidly as prey size increased. In contrast, we found only small differences in handling time of large predators. The complete functional response may provide size-refuges for very small and large M. affinis depending on the size-structure of S. entomon. 3. To investigate the realism in our functional response estimates, we incorporated the functional response in a consumption model based on the densities and size-structures of the predator and the prey in the field (Bothnian Sea). We adjusted the attack rate using a correction factor to predict the observed survival of the different age-classes of M. affinis from field samples. The field data-based consumption model accounted for 1 year of size-dependent predation by the size-structured population of S. entomon on M. affinis. In addition, using a growth model for S. entomon we checked that the predicted consumption by the predator gave realistic growth curves. We found that the experimentally derived attack rates may have been over-estimated by a factor of 400.},

abstract = {We present a handy mechanistic functional response model that realistically incorporates handling (i.e., attacking and eating) and digesting prey. We briefly review current functional response theory and thereby demonstrate that such a model has been lacking so far. In our model, we treat digestion as a background process that does not prevent further foraging activities (i.e., searching and handling). Instead, we let the hunger level determine the probability that the predator searches for new prey. Additionally, our model takes into account time wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main assumption of our model is that the predator's hunger is in a steady state, we term it the steady-state satiation (SSS) equation. The SSS equation yields a new formula for the asymptotic maximum predation rate (i.e., asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit time, for prey density approaching infinity). According to this formula, maximum predation rate is determined not by the sum of the time spent for handling and digesting prey, but solely by the larger of these two terms. As a consequence, predators can be categorized into two types: handling-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by handling time) and digestion-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by digestion time). We give examples of both predator types. Based on available data, we suggest that most predators are digestion limited. The SSS equation is a conceptual mechanistic model. Two possible applications of this model are that (1) it can be used to calculate the effects of changing predator or prey characteristics (e.g., defenses) on predation rate and (2) optimal foraging models based on the SSS equation are testable alternatives to other approaches. This may improve optimal foraging theory, since one of its major problems has been the lack of alternative models.},

abstract = {Predator-prey dynamics is most simply and commonly described by Lotka-Volterra-type ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for continuous population density variables in the limit of large population sizes. One popular extension of these ODEs is the so-called Rosenzweig-MacArthur model in which various interaction rates between the populations have a nonlinear dependence on the prey concentration. Nonlinear 'functional responses' of this type were originally proposed by Holling on the basis of a general argument concerning the allocation of a predator's time between two activities: 'prey searching' and 'prey handling'.Although these functional responses are constructed in terms of the behaviour of an individual predator, they are routinely incorporated at the population level in models that include reproduction and death. In this paper we derive a novel three variable model for the simplest possible mathematical formulation of predator-prey dynamics that allows the interplay between these various processes to take place, on their different characteristic timescales. We study its properties in detail and show how it reduces to Holling's functional responses in special limits. As a result we are able to establish direct links between individual-level and population-level behaviour in the context of these well-known functional responses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Trophic interactions govern biomass fluxes in ecosystems, and stability in food webs. Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 × 10 -14 kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer-resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer-resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {Holling's Type II functional-response relationship is presented, and the formulations expressing the underlying organismal interactions which might generate such a relation arc generalized into the Type III response typical of predators showing learning behavior. An equation derived through an analogy with allosteric enzyme kinetics is given which will account for both Type II and Type III responses. The response behavior can be explained by three parameters: maximal feeding rate (F); an affinity constant (G) related to handling times, capture efficiencies, etc.; and the number of encounters (n) a predator must have with a prey item before becoming maximally efficient at utilizing the prey item as a resource. A discussion follows on the biological processes which result in shifts from Type II to Type III functional responses. Most of the learning processes involve changes in predator behavior associated with increasing encounters with prey, thus supporting parameter n as a major determinant in shifting thc functional response. Three hypotheses concerning the values parameters F, G, and n will assume under different ecological situations are posited: (l) food preferences will be reflected in an increase in resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G) and a decrease in values of n encounters; (2) a size ordering of the predators will result in shifts up in the resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G); while (3) increasing habitat complexity will generate decreases in n and F.},
